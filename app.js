   Plaint — drawing engine.

   Design goals, in order:
     1. Never break, whatever a small child taps or how many fingers land.
     2. Feel instant and smooth (mouse / touch / S Pen alike).
     3. Stay small and readable.

   The canvas is transparent; the "paper" is the canvas element's CSS
   background. That single choice buys us three things for free:
     - a real eraser (dropping alpha uncovers the paper again),
     - instant dark mode (recolour the CSS paper, drawing untouched),
     - a clean resize (we never repaint a background into the bitmap).

   Two menu settings, deliberately independent of one another. The colourway is
   which four pigments are in the tray — Poster, Crayon, Pastel, Water, Oil, Ink
   or Screen, each the limited palette of the medium it is named for (see
   PALETTES). The mixing model is what happens where two colours meet: none,
   light or paint (see MIXES). Any tray can be mixed any way, which is the point
   of splitting them: watercolour pigments laid down flat, or crayon worked like
   oil paint, are both things worth being able to try.

   Colour mixing (the "light" and "paint" models): strokes behave like real paint
   rather than opaque ink. New paint is mixed into whatever is already on the
   paper with pigment mixing — Mixbox (CC BY-NC, see THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md)
   when present, else spectral.js (MIT) — so blue + red makes purple, blue +
   yellow makes green, and repainting shifts the ratio — a second coat of red
   over one of blue reads as a reddish purple. The alpha
   channel doubles as the *amount* of paint on a pixel, so the mix weight is
   (paint this stroke lays down) : (paint already there). Strokes mix against a
   snapshot of the canvas taken when the first of them began, which keeps a
   stroke uniform instead of compounding with itself where segments overlap;
   lift and stroke again to mix another coat.

   The eraser is metered off the same slider: its amount is how much paint one
   rub lifts, so only the top of the meter takes the paper back to bare in a
   single pass and anything below leaves some behind for the next one.

   The palette: a second card, the same size as the toolbar and parked directly
   behind it. Lift the toolbar by its handle and the palette is revealed — a
   paint surface of its own, running all of the above, so you can daub two
   colours, scrub them together and make a third. The eyedropper in its corner
   then lifts any colour off the screen and makes it the one you paint with.
   Both are instances of `createSurface`; all they share is the pigment tables,
   which are keyed by colour and so belong to neither.

   Both surfaces are kept between visits, as PNG blobs in IndexedDB, written a
   moment after the last stroke settles. The settings live in localStorage; the
   pictures do not, because a canvas is a Blob and localStorage only holds
   strings. See "Keeping the picture".

   Pages: the address is the filing system. Put a name on the end of it and that
   is a new sheet of paper; come back to the same address and your drawing is
   still on it. The menu lists the ones you have visited, and can add the next
   in a numbered family — /house, /house_1, /house_2. See "Pages".

   Multi-touch: every pointer gets its own stroke, so a whole hand — or two
   children — can draw at once, each finger keeping the colour and size it
   started with. A pen takes over when it lands: touches are ignored while it
   is drawing or hovering, so a resting palm doesn't paint.

   Input model: a press does whatever is under it *now*, not what was under it
   when it landed. Drag along the swatches and each picks as you pass; carry on
   up onto the paper and the same press starts painting; come back down onto
   the slider and it sizes the pen. Nothing needs lifting to reach anything, so
   a hand that has found its grip never has to let go. See "Pointer routing".
